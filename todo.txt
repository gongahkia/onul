ONUL — Feature Suggestions
===========================
All proposals maintain the core philosophy: privacy-first, offline, zero-friction, selection-triggered.

1. MULTI-TARGET TIMEZONE
   Show conversion to 2-3 target zones simultaneously in the popup (e.g., your local zone + a pinned collaborator zone). Many remote workers juggle 2-3 regular zones (e.g., their own + HQ + client). A compact stacked display in the existing popup avoids opening a separate world clock. Settings UI gets a "pinned zones" list (max 3-4). Popup grows vertically to show each conversion as a row.

2. KEYBOARD SHORTCUT TRIGGER
   Allow a configurable hotkey (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+T) to convert the current selection, as an alternative to auto-trigger on every selection. Some users find auto-popup on selection distracting when they're copy-pasting non-time text frequently. A hotkey mode lets the extension stay silent until explicitly invoked. Add a toggle in settings: "Trigger mode: Auto / Hotkey only / Both".

3. SOURCE TIMEZONE OVERRIDE
   When selected text has no explicit timezone (e.g., "3:00 PM"), let the user specify a default source timezone instead of assuming local. Common scenario: reading a US company's blog that always writes times in PST but never labels them. Settings gets a "Default source timezone" dropdown (default: auto/local). Parser falls back to this when chrono returns no timezone offset.

4. RELATIVE TIME DISPLAY
   Show "in 3 hours" or "2 hours ago" alongside the converted absolute time in the popup. Gives immediate context for how far away an event is without mental math. Small secondary line in the popup: "3h 20m from now" or "1h 45m ago". Computed from diff between converted time and current time in target zone.

5. DATE DISPLAY IN POPUP
   Show the full date (e.g., "Wed, Jan 15") alongside the time when the converted result is not today. Currently the popup shows time + zone + day-diff label, but if the source is "January 15, 2025 at 3pm EST", the user only sees the converted time and "(Next Day)" — not *which* day. Add a date line when the source includes a date component or when day rollover occurs.

6. SMART FORMAT MIRRORING
   Copy the converted time in the same format as the source text. If user selected "3:00 PM PST", copy as "6:00 PM EST" (not "18:00"). If selected "1800 JST", copy as "0900 UTC". Currently copies just the raw time string. Match the input convention (12h/24h, with/without zone abbrev) to make pasting into replies seamless.

7. CONVERSION HISTORY (LOCAL ONLY)
   Keep a small local-only log of recent conversions (last 10-20) accessible from the popup settings page. Use case: "I converted a time 5 minutes ago but forgot to copy it." Stored in chrome.storage.local, never leaves the browser. Simple list with source text, converted time, and timestamp. Clear-all button for privacy.

8. ISO 8601 COPY OPTION
   Secondary copy action (e.g., right-click or small icon) that copies the converted time in ISO 8601 format (2025-01-15T18:00:00-05:00). Devs frequently need machine-readable timestamps for configs, logs, APIs. Keeps the primary click-to-copy as human-readable, adds a secondary ISO copy path.

9. TIMEZONE ABBREVIATION TOOLTIP
   On hover over the zone label in the popup (e.g., "EST (-05:00)"), show the full IANA name ("America/New_York") and whether DST is active. Helps disambiguate ambiguous abbreviations — "CST" could be US Central, China Standard, or Cuba Standard. Luxon already has this data via .zoneName and .isInDST.

10. ENABLE/DISABLE TOGGLE
    Quick on/off toggle accessible from the extension icon (badge or single-click) without opening settings. Sometimes users want to temporarily disable ONUL entirely (e.g., during a presentation or screen share) without navigating to settings or adding the current domain to the blacklist. Toggle state persists until manually re-enabled. Extension icon dims or grays out when disabled.

11. POPUP POSITION PREFERENCE
    Setting to prefer popup above/below/auto relative to selection. Some users have toolbars or sticky headers that collide with the default "above" placement. Simple 3-option radio in settings: Above (default) / Below / Auto.

12. RIGHT-CLICK CONTEXT MENU CONVERSION
    Add a "Convert timezone with ONUL" option to the browser right-click context menu when text is selected. Alternative trigger for users who prefer right-click workflows over auto-popup. Uses chrome.contextMenus API (requires "contextMenus" permission). Shows result in the same floating popup.
