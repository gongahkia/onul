# Privacy Policy for Timezone Converter Extension

**Last Updated:** February 6, 2026

## 1. Overview
Timezone Converter is a privacy-first browser extension designed to convert timezones instantly upon text selection. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your data remains yours.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage
**We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.**

- **Local Processing**: All timezone conversions and text parsing occur strictly within your browser (client-side). No selected text is ever sent to any remote server or cloud service.
- **No Analytics**: We do not use any third-party analytics or tracking scripts.
- **No Account Required**: The extension functions entirely without user accounts or login credentials.

## 3. Permissions
The extension requests the following permissions for functionally necessary reasons only:
- **"Read and write to the clipboard"** (`clipboardWrite`): To enable the "Quick Copy" feature where you can click the converted time to copy it.
- **"Storage"**: To save your local preferences (e.g., Target Timezone, 24-hour format) on your device.
- **"Scripting" / Host Permissions**: To detect text highlighting on webpages you visit. This permission is used solely to listen for selection events and display the popup.

## 4. Updates
We may update this policy occasionally. Since we do not collect user contact information, we encourage you to review this page periodically.

## 5. Contact
If you have questions about this policy, please contact us via the Chrome Web Store support tab.
